# IsometricTest



## Important

This project requires some graphical assets (a load of monsters) so you'll need to go and grab them from 

https://pvgames.itch.io/pvgames-free-assets-apex-predators

Once you've got the ZIP file place it in the data directory and extract it in-place (not in a sub-directory)

There is already a PVGames_ApexPredators directory in data, this contains the Starling Texture Atlases. The ZIP will add the required PNG files that are not in this repo.

If you've extracted everything correctly the three following directories should contain 8 x *.starling.xml and 9 x *.png each

data/PVGames_ApexPredators/Apex_Hunter
data/PVGames_ApexPredators/Apex_Predator
data/PVGames_ApexPredators/Apex_Stalker
